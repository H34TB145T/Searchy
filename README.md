# Searchy

This work is just for my Python scripting practice, so please don't take it too seriously! 
However, if I feel like adding new features, I will.

So, this script basically searches for the user's input keywords on Google, YouTube, Spotify, and Lyrics. You can choose where you want to search.

## Installation

Requirements
```sh
pip install colorama requests pyfiglet
```

Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/H34TB145T/Searchy.git
```

## Usage

Run the browserSearch file with Python3
```sh
python3 browserSearch.py
```
That's it!
Have fun!

Here's the screenshot of the script output!
